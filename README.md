# UsabilityHub Clone

This is a frontend clone of the **UsabilityHub** homepage.



## 📱 Responsiveness

Media queries have been implemented for major screen widths to ensure the design adapts to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

⚠️ Some layout or responsiveness issues might exist, especially on uncommon screen sizes. These will be improved in future updates.



## ⚙️ Efficiency Note

The code may **not be written in the most efficient or optimized way**, as this was primarily a **learning and practice project**. Improvements will be considered in upcoming revisions.





## 📌 Notes

- Responsive layout for major screen sizes
- This is a **practice project** meant to enhance frontend development skills.
- The clone is **static** and not connected to any backend services.
- Focus was on layout and visual fidelity rather than pixel-perfect accuracy.
- Future updates may refine the structure, efficiency, and responsiveness.(maybe)
